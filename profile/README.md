We develop artisanal interactive experiences of the highest quality that are relevant, efficient and a joy to use. Solving real problems, bringing simplicity back to complex situations, and putting a smile on peoples faces is what drives us.

We are a small team that is passionate about what we make and stoked on life. At the core of our work is preparing young people for their secondary education and guiding them through it.
